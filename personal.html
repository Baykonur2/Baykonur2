    <h2>About Him</h2>
    <p>Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin (1878â€“1953) was a Soviet statesman and political leader who ruled the USSR from the late 1920s until his death in 1953. 
	As General Secretary of the Communist Party and leader of the Soviet Union, 
	he implemented policies of rapid industrialization, agricultural collectivization, and the consolidation of a totalitarian regime.
    Stalin's rule was marked by extensive political purges, mass arrests, and deportations. 
    However, the Soviet Union under his leadership played a pivotal role in the defeat of Nazi Germany during World War II and emerged as a global superpower.</p>
